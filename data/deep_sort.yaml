# DeepSORT Parameters

parameters:
  MAX_DIST: 0.3         # The matching threshold. Samples with larger distance are considered an invalid match (default 0.2)
  MAX_IOU_DISTANCE: 0.7  # Gating threshold. Associations with cost larger than this value are disregarded (default 0.7)
  MAX_AGE: 80            # Maximum number of missed misses before a track is deleted (default 30)
  N_INIT: 3              # Number of frames that a track remains in initialization phase (default 3)
  NN_BUDGET: 100         # Maximum size of the appearance descriptors gallery (default 100)
  LAMBDA: 0.2            # Parameter weighing the contribution of the Mahalanobis distance and the cosine distance
